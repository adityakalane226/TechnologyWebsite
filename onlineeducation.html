            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits and personal development. Educational methods include
                teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place
                under the guidance of educators; however, learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place
                in formal or informal settings, and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks,
                feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.</p>

                are 100% virtual, excluding massively open online courses (MOOCs). Online learning, or virtual classes
                offered over the internet, is contrasted with traditional courses taken in a brick-and-mortar school
                building. It is the newest development in distance education that began in the mid-1990s with the spread
                of the internet and the World Wide Web. Learner experience is typically asynchronous, but may also
                incorporate synchronous elements. The vast majority of institutions utilize a Learning Management System

                leading to the near-total closures of schools, early childhood education and care (ECEC) services,

                Most governments decided to temporarily close educational institutions in an attempt to reduce the
                spread of COVID-19.[1][2][3] As of 12 January 2021, approximately 825 million learners are currently
